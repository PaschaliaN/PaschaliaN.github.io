		<p>Hi, my name is Paschalia. I am originally from Tanzania. I am first-year UMSI student on the Master's of Information at UMSI.
			I love photography and art. I started doing photography in 2019, and I stopped after the pandemic hit in 2020, but now I am back doing photography</p>
			<p>I am located in Ann Arbor, MI. I experienced in graduation, engagement, family events, beauty and children photoshoots. 
			However, I am open to be contacted on any photography opportunity.</p>
		<!-- I will include a call to action(button) that directs people to email or a contact form -->
