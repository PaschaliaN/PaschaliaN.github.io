		<p>Hi, my name is Paschalia. I am a first-year UMSI student doing a Master's of Information at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. 
			My concentration is in User Experience Design and Research. If you are interested in seeing my design work, 
			you can visit my Behance portfolio here <a href="https://www.behance.net/paschaliansato">Link to my Behance Portfolio</a>.
			Prior to UMSI I worked in product design, you can see my resume here if you are interested in my professional work as a designer.

		<p>
			I would describe myself as an all-around creative person.
			I love art, design, and photography. I have been drawing ever since I was little, and I started doing client work photography in 2019. 
			I do graduation, engagement, family events, beauty and children photoshoots. However, I am open to being contacted on any photography opportunity.
			I stopped after the pandemic hit in 2020, and I moved back to Tanzania(that's where I am originally from and where I took the beautiful safari photos on the safari page). 
			I am now open for business again; you can contact me on the form on this page for any photoshoot opportunity.
